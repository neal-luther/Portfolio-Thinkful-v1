			<h3>Allow me to introduce myself..</h3>
			<p>My name is Neal. Thank you for taking interest in my work.  I am based in the mountains of North Idaho near the Canadian border, nestled up within 10 minutes of the local ski resort and lake.  The beauty and remoteness of my home inspires me to produce excellent work without the stresses of a big tech hub.</p>
      <p>Continue to my "about" section to learn more or my "contact" section to connect. Cheers!</p>

			<h3>About me..</h3>
			<p>As someone that has over 10 years of corporate experience, include 5 years at the Enterprise level, I know time and resources are valuable. My aim is to provide services as efficiently as possible, with a focus on businesses with a strong foundation of stewardship and sustainability.  I am no stranger to working remote, as I have been without a full time office for over 4 years.  A few of my skills include:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>HTML/CSS</li>
         <li>Javascript</li>
         <li>Full Stack Development</li>
         <li>React</li>
         <li>Node</li>
         <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
      <p>If I am not coding, you can find me in the mountains with my family, snowboarding in the winter and mountain biking in the summer!</p>
